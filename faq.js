    answer: `To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
    Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
    Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
    Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
    Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
    Stay home if you feel unwell.
    If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance.
    Follow the directions of your local health authority.`
